Pandas Tutorial and Practice Files
==============

This repository contains my notes and practice code as I studied the very excellent book:
Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas.
It also contains some CSV files with information about US states and
territories and other similar files. This is intended for demonstrating data merging and cleaning.
Data was scraped from the US Census Beaureau and from Wikipedia.
